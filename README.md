## Installation

Node.js and the Inquirer package were installed in order for the project to work.

## Usage

The project is Node.js-based, which means that the Terminal had to be used in order to do the README. When the user inputs the data required, a high-quality README file is displayed. By doing the command Ctrl-Shift-v, everything is in order.

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. I had to use the badges and get their images, but I didn't know how to do this. Luckily, Lekas H. provided me with the necessary items. All badges are on display in the website(https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba), and are used in the detailsOfLicenses.js file.

2. I have tried ENDLESSLY to figure out how to create the generateBadge(), generateLicenseLink(), and generateLicenseSection() function. Omar Wright helped me out with that. What he did is on the website(https://github.com/omarwright07/pro-readme-generator), and MY OWN VERSION OF THE FUNCTIONS is in the generateMarkdown.js file. Easy.

Other than that, I can safely say that the content of this project is my own, original work.
